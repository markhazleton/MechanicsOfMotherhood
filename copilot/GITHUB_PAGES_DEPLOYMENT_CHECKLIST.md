## ðŸš€ Deployment Commands

### Development

```bash
npm run dev                    # Start development server
npm run preview:github         # Preview production build with GitHub base path
```

### Testing & Validation

```bash
npm run check                  # TypeScript type checking
npm run validate-data          # Validate data quality
npm run deploy:check           # Full deployment validation
```

### Building

```bash
npm run build:github           # Full build with data fetch, sitemap, and validation
npm run build:static           # Production build only
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Blank page after deployment**: Check browser console for base path issues
2. **404 on refresh**: Ensure 404.html has correct pathSegmentsToKeep value
3. **Assets not loading**: Verify base path in vite.config.ts
4. **Build failures**: Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check build locally
npm run build:github && npm run preview:github

# Validate all systems
npm run deploy:check

# Check for TypeScript issues
npm run check
```

### GitHub Actions Debugging

- Check Actions tab in GitHub repository
- Review build logs for specific error messages
- Ensure all environment variables are configured
- Verify repository permissions and settings

## ðŸ“Š Performance Optimization
