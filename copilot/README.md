# Copilot Documentation Folder

This folder contains documentation, guides, and reports generated by AI agents and other automated tools working on the Mechanics of Motherhood project.

## Purpose

The `/copilot` folder serves as the designated location for all generated markdown files to:

1. **Keep the root directory clean** - Prevents documentation clutter in the main project directory
2. **Organize AI-generated content** - Centralized location for all agent-created documentation
3. **Maintain project structure** - Separates generated docs from core project files
4. **Enable easy maintenance** - All generated documentation in one place for review and cleanup

## Contents

This folder contains various types of documentation:

- **Implementation guides** - Step-by-step guides for specific features or tasks
- **Migration plans** - Documentation for technology upgrades and migrations  
- **Status reports** - Current state and progress reports for ongoing work
- **Best practices** - Coding standards and development guidelines
- **API documentation** - Integration guides and API specifications
- **Build guides** - Deployment and build process documentation

## Instructions for AI Agents

When generating any `.md` files (documentation, guides, reports, etc.), **ALWAYS** place them in this `/copilot` folder, not in the project root or other directories. This applies to:

- Technical documentation
- Implementation guides
- Migration plans
- Status reports
- Best practices documents
- API documentation
- Any other markdown content

## File Organization

Files in this folder should follow these naming conventions:

- Use UPPERCASE for major documents (e.g., `API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the content purpose
- Include dates in filenames when relevant (e.g., `MIGRATION_STATUS_2024_01_15.md`)
- Group related files with consistent prefixes when applicable

## Maintenance

This folder should be periodically reviewed to:

- Archive outdated documentation
- Consolidate related documents
- Update links and references
- Remove obsolete files
