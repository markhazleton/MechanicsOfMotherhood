# Tailwind CSS v4 Migration Execution Report

Date: 2025-09-04

## Actions Performed

- Added `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin and updated `vite.config.ts` accordingly.
- Upgraded `tailwindcss` dependency from v3.4.17 to `^4.0.0` placeholder (assuming availability) in `package.json`.
- Removed `autoprefixer` and `postcss` explicit usage (PostCSS config reduced to empty placeholder).
- Simplified `tailwind.config.ts` to content + plugins only (design tokens moving toward CSS `@theme`).
- Converted `client/src/index.css` to use `@import "tailwindcss";` and introduced an initial `@theme` block with fonts, radii, and animations.
- Added animation design tokens (`--animate-*`) to align with v4 custom properties approach.

## Outstanding Items / Follow-ups

1. Verify plugin compatibility versions for `tailwindcss-animate` and `@tailwindcss/typography` when v4 final releases new majors.
2. Consider consolidating duplicated semantic color custom properties (some tokens exist both in `:root` and `@theme`).
3. Optional: introduce container queries for adaptive recipe layout.
4. Optional: add print stylesheet layer for `@media print` optimized recipe output.
5. Monitor bundle size; consider further code-splitting large `index-*.js` chunk.

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. Revert `package.json` Tailwind & plugin dependency changes.
2. Restore previous `tailwind.config.ts` from git history.
3. Replace `@import "tailwindcss"` with original `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;` directives.
4. Remove `@tailwindcss/vite` from `vite.config.ts`.

## Next Validation Steps

1. Run `npm install` to fetch new deps.
2. Execute `npm run dev` and inspect console for Tailwind warnings.
3. Perform visual regression on key pages (home, recipe detail, typography-heavy pages).
4. Confirm dark mode class toggling still works.
5. Lighthouse performance snapshot to compare CSS size & build speed.

## Notes

Initial migration complete; project now uses v4-native tokens and minimal config. Further refinements are incremental (performance & DX). Ensure CI caches Tailwind v4 to avoid cold compile cost.
